# Papers...

:bulb: all about ideas.. publishing is a consequence

:bulb: not everyone needs to read Nature, Science... only the ones who want to be successful

:bulb: lay down your contribution **asap**, _i.e._, **in the title**

:bulb: the editor is not your friend; their are there to put you off; it is your job to convince them of the opposite


# Coding

## Libraries (talk @ PyCon Br 2016)

    "The API of your library"

    "Make the simple easy, the complete possible, and the wrong impossible"

    "Asymetry in behaviour should imply asymetry in shape"

    "The highest objective of an API is to eliminate the integration discontinuity"

:bulb: "Principle of least astonishment": avoid the user saying 'whaaat' at any level: aestethic, semantic, funcional...

:bulb: Law of leaky abstractions, _e.g._, pretending a local call is a remote call (gonna spill over at someday for sure, just a matter of time)

:bulb: Return resources (_e.g._, `pyfant.run_parallel`)

:bulb: several levels of abstraction is a good thing

:bulb: lego x playmobil: granular x non-granular

:bulb: top-down: how do I want people to use this?

:bulb: zen of Python: make an obvious way!!!!!!!!
