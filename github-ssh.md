# Communicating with GitHub _via_ SSH

This will configure automatic authentication and transfer to GitHub _via_ SSH, so `git push` will no longer ask
for user name and password.
 
The steps involved are roughly summarized below. For full details, please follow the
links provided.

:one: Generate a SSH key

```shell
ls -al ~/.ssh  # Check existing SSH keys
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your@email.com"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

**Note** if `ssh-add ...` above fails: run `eval ``ssh-agent -s`` ` and retry

:two: Open file _ ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub_ using any text editor and copy its contents to the clipboard (Ctrl+C)

:three: Go to GitHub, personal settings, look for "SSH and GPG keys", click on "New SSH key", and paste the contents of _~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub_ into the appropriate box.

After you do this, you can test if it works:
```shell
ssh -T git@github.com
 ```
 
:four: Change the remote URL that git uses

```shell
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:user-name/repository-name.git
```
